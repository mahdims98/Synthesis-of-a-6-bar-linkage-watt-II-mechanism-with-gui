# Synthesis-of-a-6-bar-linkage-watt-II-mechanism-with-gui
kinematic and dynamic analysis of a 6 bar linkage watt II mechanism

- PyQt5 is used to develop the GUI. In the software, it is possible to plot velocity and acceleration plots for each node. Also, free body diagram of the hinges are plotted in the dynamic part
- Classes can be used to solve any type of 4 linkage mechanisms with minor modifications. 

# GUI
### Kinematics (with animations)
